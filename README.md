## Overview:
This project focuses on a rescue robot designed for disaster scenarios, leveraging both wired and wireless connectivity via ROS for effective communication. Equipped with various sensors, including cameras, lidar, Kinect, IMU, and encoders, it assesses inaccessible areas, relaying critical environmental data to aid rescue efforts.

Its innovative mechanical design, featuring flipper and main drive mechanisms, ensures stability on uneven terrain and allows access to confined spaces. The compact size enhances its ability to navigate tight areas, while its agility proves crucial in time-sensitive situations. Controlled via a user interface, this robot serves as a vital tool in disaster response, bridging the gap between inaccessible locations and rescue teams.
